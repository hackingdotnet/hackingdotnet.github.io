<p>This site is supposed to be dedicated to producing high quality and in depth technical content for your consumption. It is written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eddierangel">Eddie Rangel</a>, a Software Engineer, Teacher, and Philosopher currently based in Bakersfield, CA. </p>

<h3>Who I am</h3> 
<p>Hello, my name is Eddie Rangel. I am a Software Engineer, teacher, and all around Californian. I am also a husband and father. We currently reside in Bakersfield, CA.</P>

    <h3>Why .Net?</h3>
    Why not? There are more programming languages than one realizes. As a computer scientist it's important to understand the basic 
    constructs of languages in general. This is why many undergraduate programs include a survey course around programming languages.
    This trend carries over to careers in software engineering and development. This is easily seen in Web Development where having 
    knowledge in static and dynamic languages is almost a necessity.

    This site will be dedicated to helping developers level up on C#, the .Net Framework, and TypeScript. The kata's that will be developed
    will be geared toward understanding the fundamental concepts of computer science. These topics will begin with basic object oriented principles
    such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It will continue through data structures and algorithm analysis. There will also be
    course work for operating systems and database systems.
