    <h3>Course Listing</h3>
    Below are courses I have been responsible for teaching. They include courses at both a 
    2 year and 4 year University Systems. I am also in the progress of creating my own content
    around technologies I am passionate about.

    <h3>Microsoft Stack</h3>
    These are courses that I have developed, or are being developed. The purpose of these
    courses is to bring concepts normally taught in a Computer Science cirriculumn
    but using the Microsoft stack. Historically, Computer Science Departments use traditional 
    languages and systems such as C/C++ and Unix/Linux for teaching core concepts. Then typically
    use Java for concepts such as algorithm design, advanced data structures and web programming. Oracle is tpypically the
    default for a Database Systems course. It is my goal to introduce Microsoft's stack to 
    those learners seeking the rigors of a college computer science curriculum, flexiblity of
    learning online, and a focus on Microsoft's technology stack.
    They're being hosted on Github.
