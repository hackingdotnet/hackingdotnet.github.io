#####What Information is Collected?
This site does not itself collect data. It's a site hosted on GitHub.com. However, I do use Google Analytics so it may be worth looking at [Google Analytic's privacy policy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). I also use Disqus for comments, so you may also want to take a look at [Disqus's privacy policy](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy).
