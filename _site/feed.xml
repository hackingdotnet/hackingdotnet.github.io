        <title>Hacking Education</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer Science curriculumn in post secondary education varies in breadth and depth. One consitent
component is the study of C/C++ as the foundation of fundamental prgramming courses and Unix to serve
as the foundation for systems programming and operating systems courses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the years Computer Science curriculumn has evolved to include Object Oriented Programming, Networking, and Client/Server Architecture.
Fundmental programming courses vary from using C/C++ to Python. Upper division courses typically include Java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hacking .Net is dedicated to delivering a set of courses aimed at teaching computer science through the lens of
the .Net Core Framework.&lt;/p&gt;
